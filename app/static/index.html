              Email Service v.2
            </Heading>
            <p>
              This is a straightforward, no-frills email service built to facilitate email communication for all of my web applications. Currently, as I am still in the process of building the application(s), this service operates independently. This is the second iteration.
              <Space howMuch={20 - 5} />
              I developed it to run within a <Link linkText="Docker">https://www.docker.com/</Link> container using <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker Compose</a>. In the initial <a href="https://github.com/ddcroft73/email-service">version</a>, the API was built within a virtual environment (venv) and required launching through two shell scripts. The second script was used to launch the <a href="http://www.celeryproject.org/">Celery</a> worker(s). However, I wasn't satisfied with this approach, so I took the initiative to learn how to use Docker Compose.
              <Space howMuch={20 - 5} />
              The service employs Celery to handle email delivery, essentially receiving a request, forwarding it, and awaiting the next request. I have conducted thorough testing, although I am still in the process of mastering proper testing methodologies such as Test-Driven Development (TDD). Currently, my testing involves a script that repeatedly sends requests to the endpoint, including scenarios designed to cause failures. Remarkably, even without Celery, the application handles these situations gracefully. I attribute this success to the robustness of <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a>, and I must acknowledge the brilliance of FastAPI's design, as well as ease of use.  
              <Space howMuch={20 - 5} />
              One of the final things I have added to this microservice is a custom logger to record and organize every action the application renders. I found myself spending too much time trying to get the Python logger to do exactly what I wanted, consistently. So I spent some more time, making my own that works. import  it, and send a log entry to INFO, DEBUG, ERROR, or WARNING. Thats literally it. Each level message will be kept together, or if you dont want to dedicate an entire file to one level, then it will default to a default log. WHenever a log is full it will automatically archive itself and create a new one to pick upon. Now once I do figure out that the py logger isnt really all that difficult, I will feel stupid. But in the meantime, this is a really useful substitute thats a no brainer. I had a ball writing it and I believ it strengthend my understanding of OOP.

              API Logger 
            </Heading>
            <p>
              I built a custom logger escpecially designed to work fluently with this application type. It's not like the Python Logger which is superior
              but its a lot easier to use and as far as debugging an API, It's saved me from much frustration. When it cones to production I will then 
              implement an asynchronous logger I can feel confient about. This logger was just a way to give me a fast look inside without having to 
              worry about levels. 

              THere are endpoints dedicated to the output of this logger. I am leaving them for now and may use them for another logger in production.
              Not sure how all that will play out yet.

              when I decide on a domain name, I will switch to <Hl>email</Hl>s which is a bit better email library. I am currently using a 
              dedicated Gmail account and due to this, I cannot get the two to play together.
